"Visualize your Mahjong boards as heatmaps! ðŸ€„"

</p>


## Preface

The code you are currently reading was originally designed for visualizing [Japanese Mahjong board states](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trongdt/japanese-mahjong-board-states), and is used in my thesis: ["A Supervised Attention-Based Multiclass Classifier for Tile Discarding in Japanese Mahjong"](https://hdl.handle.net/11250/2823898). The code has since been improved for future use. 

If you choose to use it in your works, be it academic or personal work, it would mean a lot to me if you credited my code in your works.

## How to use

1. Copy `mahjong_heatmap.py` into your project.
2. Install necessary Python libraries (see [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)).
3. Import file into your code, see [Jupyter Notebook](./generate_mahjong_heatmap.ipynb) for example usages.
